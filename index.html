        <p id="p1"> You are walking out of the supermarket. As you approach your car, a stranger calls out, “Hey! Funny
          weather today!” With a due sense of caution—is she a  <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover11.png" /></a> denier or not?—you reply yes.
          There is a slight hesitation. Is it because she is thinking of saying something about global warming? In
          any case, the hesitation induced you to think of it. Congratulations: you are living proof that you have
          entered the time of hyperobjects. Why? You can no longer have a routine conversation about the
          weather with a stranger. The presence of <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/hover.png" /></a> looms into the conversation like a shadow,
          introducing strange gaps. Or <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover10.png" /></a> is spoken or—either way the reality is strange.

        </p>
        <p id=p1>
          A <a href="#">hyperobject<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover15.png" /></a> has ruined the weather conversation, which functions as part of a neutral screen that
          enables us to have a human drama in the foreground. In an age of <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover14.png" /></a>, there is no
          background, and thus there is no foreground. It is the end of the world, since worlds depend on
          backgrounds and foregrounds. World is a fragile aesthetic effect around whose corners we are
          beginning to see. True planetary awareness is the creeping realization not that “We Are the World,”
          but that we aren’t.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          Why? Because world and its cognates—environment, Nature—are ironically more objectified
          than the kinds of “object” I am talking about in this study. World is more or less a container in which
          objectified things float or stand. It doesn’t matter very much whether the movie within the context of
          world is an old-fashioned Aristotelian movie of substances decorated with accidents; or whether the
          movie is a more avant-garde Deleuzian one of flows and intensities. World as the background of
          events is an objectification of a hyperobject: the biosphere, climate, evolution, capitalism (yes,
          perhaps economic relations compose hyper-objects). So when climate starts to rain on our head, we
          have no idea what is happening. It is easy to practice denial in such a cognitive space: to set up, for
          example, “debates” in which different “sides” on <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover17.png" /></a> are presented. This taking of
          “sides” correlates all meaning and agency to the human realm, while in reality it isn’t a question of
          sides, but of real entities and human reactions to them. Environmentalism seems to be talking about
          something that can’t be seen or touched. So in turn environmentalism ups the ante and preaches the
          coming apocalypse. This constant attempt to shock and dismay inspires even more defiance on the
          opposite side of the “debate.”
        </p>
        <p id="p1">
          Both sides are fixated on world, just as both sides of the atheism debate are currently fixated on a
          vorhanden (“present at hand”), objectively present God. As irritating for New Atheists such as
          Richard Dawkins to hear that atheism is just another form of belief, it nevertheless is—or at any rate,
          it holds exactly the same belief about belief as the fundamentalists. Belief is a token, a mental object
          that you grip as hard as possible, like your wallet or car keys. In exactly the same way, it is annoying
          for environmentalists to talk about ecology without Nature. The argument is heard as nihilism or
          postmodernism. But really it is environmentalism that is nihilist and postmodernist, just as
          fundamentalism’s belief about belief marks it as a form of ontotheological nihilism. The ultimate
          environmentalist argument would be to drop the concepts Nature and world, to cease identifying with
          them, to swear allegiance to coexistence with nonhumans without a world, without some nihilistic
          Noah’s Ark.

          In any weather conversation, one of you is going to mention <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover18.png" /></a> at some point. Or you
          both decide not to mention it but it looms over the conversation like a dark cloud, brooding off the
          edge of an ellipsis.1 This failure of the normal rhetorical routine, these remnants of shattered
          conversation lying around like broken hammers (they must take place everywhere), is a symptom of a
          much larger and deeper ontological shift in human awareness. And in turn, this is a symptom of a
          profound upgrade of our ontological tools. As anyone who has waited while the little rainbow circle
          goes around and around on a Mac, these upgrades are not necessarily pleasant. It is very much the job
          of philosophers and other humanities scholars to attune ourselves to the upgrading process and to help
          explain it.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          What is the upgrading process? In a word, the notion that we are living “in” a world—one that we
          can call Nature—no longer applies in any meaningful sense, except as nostalgia or in the temporarily
          useful local language of pleas and petitions. We don’t want a certain species to be farmed to
          extinction, so we use the language of Nature to convince a legislative body. We have a general feeling
          of ennui and malaise and create nostalgic visions of hobbit-like worlds to inhabit. These syndromes
          have been going on now since the Industrial Revolution began to take effect.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          As a <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover22.png" /></a> of that revolution, however, something far bigger and more threatening is now
          looming on our horizon—looming so as to abolish our horizon, or any horizon. <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover19.png" /></a> has
          performed a radical shift in the status of the weather. Why? Because the world as such—not just a
          specific idea of world but world in its entirety—has evaporated. Or rather, we are realizing that we
          never had it in the first place.
        </p>
        <p id="p1">
          We could explain this in terms of the good old-fashioned Aristotelian view of substance and
          accidents. For Aristotle, a realist, there are substances that happen to have various qualities or
          accidents that are not intrinsic to their substantiality. In section Epsilon 2 of the Metaphysics
          Aristotle outlines the differences between substances and accidents. What <a href="#">climate change <img src="images/tweetscrape/hover13.png" /></a> has done is
          shift the weather from accidental to substantial. Aristotle writes, “Suppose, for instance, that in the
          season of the Cynosure [the Dog Days of summer] arctic cold were to prevail, this we would regard
          as an accident, whereas, if there were a sweltering heatwave, we would not. And this is because the
          latter, unlike the former, is always or for the most part the case.”2 But these sorts of violent changes
          are exactly what <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover20.png" /></a> predicts. So every accident of the weather becomes a potential
          symptom of a substance, <a href="#">global warming<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover21.png" /></a>. All of a sudden this wet stuff falling on my head is a mere
          feature of some much more sinister phenomenon that I can’t see with my naked human eyes. I need
          terabytes of RAM to model it in real time (this has been available for about ten years).
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          There is an even spookier problem arising from Aristotle’s arctic summer idea. If those arctic
          summers continue, and if we can model them as symptoms of global warming, then there never was a
          genuine, meaningful (for us humans) sweltering summer, just a long period of sweltering that seemed
          real because it kept on repeating for, say, two or three millennia. Global warming plays a very mean
          trick. It reveals that what we took to be a reliable world was actually just a habitual pattern—a
          collusion between forces such as <a href="#">sunshine<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover6.png" /></a> and moisture and humans expecting such things at certain
          regular intervals and giving them names, such as Dog Days. We took weather to be real. But in an age
          of global warming we see it as an accident, a simulation of something darker, more withdrawn—
          climate.As Harman argues, world is always presence-at-hand—a mere caricature of some real
          object.3
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          Now let’s think the evaporation of world from the point of view of foreground and background. A
          weather conversation provides a nice background to our daily affairs, nice to the extent that we don’t
          pay too much attention to it. Precisely for it to be a background, it has to operate in our peripheral
          vision. Thus, the conversation about the weather with a stranger is a safe way to acknowledge our
          coexistence in social space. It’s “phatic,” according to Roman Jakobson’s six-part model of
          communication; that is, it draws attention to the material medium in which the communication is
          occurring.4 Likewise, the weather as such is a background phenomenon. It might loom distressingly
          into the foreground as a tornado or as a drought, but most often those are temporary affairs—there is a
          larger temporal backdrop against which they seem to occur as isolated incidents.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          Now what happens when global warming enters the scene? The background ceases to be a
          background, because we have started to observe it. Strange weather patterns and carbon emissions
          caused scientists to start monitoring things that at first only appeared locally significant. That’s the
          old definition of climate: there’s the climate in Peru, the climate on Long Island, and so on. But
          climate in general, climate as the totality of derivatives of weather events—in much the same way as
          inertia is a derivative of velocity—is a beast newly recognized via the collaboration of weather,
          scientists, satellites, government agencies, and other entities. This beast includes the sun, since it’s
          infrared heat from the sun that is trapped by the greenhouse effect of gases such as CO2. So global
          warming is a colossal entity that includes entities that exist way beyond Earth’s atmosphere, and yet it
          affects us intimately, right here and now. Global warming covers the entire surface of Earth, and 75
          percent of it extends five hundred years into the future. Remember what life was like in the early
          1500s?
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          Global warming is really here—even more spookily, it was already here, already influencing the
          supposedly real wet stuff falling on my head and the warm golden stuff burning my face at the beach.
          That wet stuff and that golden stuff, which we call weather, turns out to have been a false immediacy,
          an ontic pseudo-reality that can’t stand up against the looming presence of an invisible yet far more
          real global climate. Weather, that handy backdrop for human lifeworlds, has ceased to exist, and
          along with it, the cozy concept of lifeworld itself. Lifeworld was just a story we were telling
          ourselves on the inside of a vast, massively distributed hyperobject called climate, a story about how
          different groups were partitioned according to different horizons—concepts now revealed as ontic
          prejudices smuggled into the realm of ontology. Global warming is a big problem, because along with
          melting glaciers it has melted our ideas of world and worlding. Thus, the tools that humanists have at
          their disposal for talking about the ecological emergency are now revealed, by global warming itself,
          to be as useless as the proverbial chocolate teapot. It is rather like the idea of using an antique (or
          better, antiqued) Christmas ornament as a weapon.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          The spooky thing is, we discover global warming precisely when it’s already here. It is like
          realizing that for some time you had been conducting your business in the expanding sphere of a slowmotion
          nuclear bomb. You have a few seconds for amazement as the fantasy that you inhabited a neat,
          seamless little world melts away. All those apocalyptic narratives of doom about the “end of the
          world” are, from this point of view, part of the problem, not part of the solution. By postponing doom
          into some hypothetical future, these narratives inoculate us against the very real object that has
          intruded into ecological, social, and psychic space. As we shall see, the hyperobject spells doom now, not at some future date. (Doom will assume a special technical meaning in this study in the
          “Hypocrisies” section.)
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          If there is no background—no neutral, peripheral stage set of weather, but rather a very visible,
          highly monitored, publicly debated climate—then there is no foreground. Foregrounds need
          backgrounds to exist. So the strange effect of dragging weather phenomena into the foreground as part
          of our awareness of global warming has been the gradual realization that there is no foreground! The
          idea that we are embedded in a phenomenological lifeworld, tucked up like little hobbits into the
          safety of our burrow, has been exposed as a fiction. The specialness we granted ourselves as
          unravelers of cosmic meaning, exemplified in the uniqueness of Heideggerian Dasein, falls apart
          since there is no meaningfulness possible in a world without a foreground–background distinction.
          Worlds need horizons and horizons need backgrounds, which need foregrounds. When we can see
          everywhere (when I can use Google Earth to see the fish in my mom’s pond in her garden in London),
          the world—as a significant, bounded, horizoning entity—disappears. We have no world because the
          objects that functioned as invisible scenery have dissolved.5
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          World is an aesthetic effect based on a blurriness and aesthetic distance. This blurriness derives
          from ignorance concerning objects. Only in ignorance can objects act like blank screens for the
          projection of meaning. “Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight” is a charming old saw that evokes days
          when shepherds lived in worlds bounded by horizons on which things such as red sunsets occurred.
          The sun goes down, the sun comes up—of course now we know it doesn’t: Galileo and Copernicus
          tore holes in that notion of world. Likewise, as soon as humans know about climate, weather becomes
          a flimsy, superficial appearance that is a mere local representation of some much larger phenomenon
          that is strictly invisible. You can’t see or smell climate. Given our brains’ processing power, we
          can’t even really think about it all that concretely. At the very least, world means significantly less
          than it used to—it doesn’t mean “significant for humans” or even “significant for conscious entities.”
        </p>
        <p id="p1">
          A simple experiment demonstrates plainly that world is an aesthetic phenomenon. I call it The
          Lord of the Rings vs. the Ball Popper Test. For this experiment you will need a copy of The Two
          Towers, the second part of director Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy.6 You will also require
          a Playskool Busy Ball Popper, made by Hasbro. Now play the scene that I consider to be the absolute
          nadir of horror, when Frodo, captured by Faramir, is staggering around the bombed-out city Osgiliath
          when a Nazgul (a ringwraith) attacks on a “fell beast,” a terrifying winged dragon-like creature.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          Switch on the Ball Popper. You will notice the inane tunes that the Popper plays instantly
          undermine the coherence of Peter Jackson’s narrative world.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          The idea of world depends on all kinds of mood lighting and mood music, aesthetic effects that by
          definition contain a kernel of sheer ridiculous meaninglessness. It’s the job of serious Wagnerian
          worlding to erase the trace of this meaninglessness. Jackson’s trilogy surely is Wagnerian, a total
          work of art (Gesamtkunstwerk) in which elves, dwarves, and men have their own languages, their
          own tools, their own architecture, done to fascist excess as if they were different sports teams. But
          it’s easy to recover the trace of meaninglessness from this seamless world—absurdly easy, as the toy
          experiment proves. In effect, this stupid kids’ toy “translated” the movie, clashing with it and altering
          it in its own limited and unique way.

          Objections to wind farms and solar arrays are often based on arguments that they “spoil the
          view.”7 The aesthetics of Nature truly impedes ecology, and a good argument for why ecology must
          be without Nature. How come a wind turbine is less beautiful than an oil pipe? How come it “spoils
          the view” any more than pipes and roads? You could see turbines as environmental art. Wind chimes
          play in the wind; some environmental sculptures sway and rock in the breeze. Wind farms have a
          slightly frightening size and magnificence. One could easily read them as embodying the aesthetics of
          the sublime (rather than the beautiful). But it’s an ethical sublime, one that says, “We humans choose
          not to use carbon”—a choice visible in gigantic turbines. Perhaps it’s this very visibility of choice
          that makes wind farms disturbing: visible choice, rather than secret pipes, running under an
          apparently undisturbed “landscape” (a word for a painting, not actual trees and water). As a poster in
          the office of Mulder in the television series The X-Files says, “The Truth Is Out There.” Ideology is
          not just in your head. It’s in the shape of a Coke bottle. It’s in the way some things appear “natural”—
          rolling hills and greenery—as if the Industrial Revolution had never occurred, and moreover, as if
          agriculture was Nature. The “landscape” look of agriculture is the original “greenwashing.”
          Objectors to wind farms are not saying “Save the environment!” but “Leave our dreams undisturbed!”
          World is an aesthetic construct that depends on things like underground oil and gas pipes. A profound
          political act would be to choose another aesthetic construct, one that doesn’t require smoothness and
          distance and coolness. World is by no means doing what it should to help ecological criticism.
          Indeed, the more data we have, the less it signifies a coherent world.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          World is a function of a very long-lasting and complex set of social forms that we could roughly
          call the logistics of agriculture. New Zealand is an astonishing place where there are fifteen sheep for
          every human, a hyperbolic blowup of the English Lake District. It was deliberately manufactured that
          way. World is not just an idea in your head. It’s in the way the fields roll toward a horizon, on top of
          which a red setting sun augurs peace and contentment. It’s in the smooth, lawn-like texture of sheepnibbled
          grass: “First the labourers are driven from the land, and then the sheep arrive.”8 Wind farms
          are an eyesore on this aestheticized landscape. Agriculture, in this view, is an ancient technological
          world-picture, to use Heidegger’s terms: a form of framing that turns reality into so much stuff on tap
          (Bestand).9 Agriculture is a major contributor to global warming, not just because of flatulent cows,
          but because of the enormous technical machinery that goes into creating the agricultural stage set, the
          world. Perhaps the solution to this is suggested by the kinds of “perverse” technologies developed by
          pot farmers: to create intensive growth in a small space. Just as the porn industry accelerated the
          development of the Internet, so the drug industry might be our ecological savior. Stranger things have
          happened. Preserving the agricultural world picture just as it is, however, has already become a
          costly disaster.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          To return to an example close to New Zealand’s heart, The Lord of the Rings presents an
          agricultural landscape that never explains itself. Sure, the Rangers such as Aragorn protect it. But
          how does it work? For whom and with whom is the growing and the harvesting and the selling done?
          Hobbiton is constructed to induce nostalgia for a suburban future that thinks itself as a Georgic idyll.
          To do so requires all kinds of lighting, rendering, and mood music—it also requires the threats of
          Mordor and orcs that make us care about bland suburbia. Just changing the Wagnerian music would
          destroy its delicate “balance.”

          Village Homes is a world-like real illusion that rests in the northwest area of Davis, California.
          Each street is named after a place or  <a href="#">person<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover26.png" /></a> in The Lord of the Rings: Evenstar Lane, Bombadil
          Lane. The streets are concentric yet nontopologically equivalent, so there is a real feeling of being
          lost in there. There are vineyards and pomegranate trees. There is a village-green-like space with an
          amphitheater built into the grass. There is a children’s day care called Rivendell. It is all very
          beautiful; it’s very well done. There is already a nostalgia for the present there, not simply for
          Tolkien, but for an ecological vision of the 1970s when Village Homes was designed. There is one
          slight problem: you have to have an awful lot of money to live there. And there is a rule that you have
          to work in the collective allotments. As a friend quipped, “One homeowner’s association to rule them
          all.”
        </p>
        <p id="p1">
          There are many reasons why, even if world were a valid concept altogether, it shouldn’t be used as
          the basis for ethics. Consider only this: witch ducking stools constitute a world just as much as
          hammers. There was a wonderful world of witch ducking in the Middle Ages in which witches were
          “discovered” by drowning them, strapped to an apparatus that submerged them in the local stream: if
          the supposed witch didn’t drown, she was a witch—and should thus be burned at the stake. Witch
          ducking stools constituted a world for their users in every meaningful sense. There is a world of Nazi
          regalia. Just because the Nazis had a world, doesn’t mean we should preserve it. So the argument that
          “It’s good because it constitutes a world” is flimsy at best. The reason not to interfere with the
          environment because it’s interfering with someone’s or something’s world is nowhere near a good
          enough reason. It might even have pernicious consequences. World and worlding are a dangerously
          weak link in the series of late-Heideggerian concepts.10 It is as if humans are losing both their world
          and their idea of world (including the idea that they ever had a world) at one and the same time, a
          disorienting fact. In this historical moment, working to transcend our notion of world is important.
          Like a mannerist painting that stretches the rules of classicism to a breaking point, global warming has
          stretched our world to breaking point. Human beings lack a world for a very good reason: because no
          entity at all has a world, or as Harman puts it, “There is no such thing as a ‘horizon.’”11 The “world”
          as the significant totality of what is the case is strictly unimaginable, and for a good reason: it doesn’t
          exist.

          What is left if we aren’t the world? Intimacy. We have lost the world but gained a soul—the
          entities that coexist with us obtrude on our awareness with greater and greater urgency. Three cheers
          for the so-called end of the world, then, since this moment is the beginning of history, the end of the
          human dream that reality is significant for them alone. We now have the prospect of forging new
          alliances between humans and non-humans alike, now that we have stepped out of the cocoon of
          world.

          About six minutes into Pierre Boulez’s piece Répons, the percussive instruments come in. They
          surround the smoother instruments (brass, strings), which are playing in a square in the center of the
          concert hall. The percussive instruments (piano, dulcimer, harp, and so on) are processed through
          various delays and filters. The sound of their entry is now evocative of speculative realism: the sound
          of a vaster world bursting into the human, or the reverse, the sound of a trapdoor opening in a plane,
          or the plane itself disappearing so we find ourselves in the wide blue sky. A terrifying, wonderful
          sound, the Kantian sublime of inner freedom giving way to a speculative sublime of disturbing
          intimacy. The sound of the end of the world but not an apocalypse, not a predictable conclusion. The
          sound of something beginning, the sound of discovering yourself inside of something. Boulez himself
          probably thought Répons was about the sound of modern human technology, Gesellschaft (modern
          “society”) impinging on Gemeinschaft (the “organic community”), and so forth. Or the idea of a
          dialogue between equal partners, a dialectical play between the organic and electronic. The piece is
          much more that that. It’s the sound of real entities appearing to humans. But as I’ve been arguing, real
          nonhuman entities appear to humans at first as blips on their monitors. But they are not those blips.
          The sound of a higher-dimensional configuration space impinging on extreme Western music (total
          serialism). The sound of hyperobjects. The sound of a nonmusic. Listen to the very end: the sound
          echoes and reverberates, repeating glissandos; then, suddenly, it’s over. No fade out. Robert Cahen
          captures it well in his deceptively simple film of Répons, visualizing the “human sounds” as a
          traditional orchestral ensemble juxtaposed with revolving and panning shots of trees, and the
          percussive sounds as humans mediated by a luminous ocean.12 When the percussive instruments
          enter, the camera on the orchestra pans back to reveal them surrounding the other players, and we see
          the studio lighting rig, as if the structures that hold the fragile fiction of world together have
          evaporated. Just as most of Earth’s surface is water, the sonic space is surrounded by the chilling,
          sparkling sounds of piano, harp, and glockenspiel.

          Instead of trying constantly to tweak an illusion, thinking and art and political practice should
          simply relate directly to nonhumans. We will never “get it right” completely. But trying to come up
          with the best world is just inhibiting ecological progress. Art and architecture in the time of
          hyperobjects must (automatically) directly include hyperobjects, even when they try to ignore them.
          Consider the contemporary urge to maximize throughput: to get dirty air flowing with air conditioners.
          Air conditioning is now the benchmark of comfort; young Singaporeans are starting to sweat out of
          doors, habituated to the homogeneous thermal comfort of modern buildings.13 Such architecture and
          design is predicated on the notion of “away.” But there is no “away” after the end of the world. It
          would make more sense to design in a dark ecological way, admitting our coexistence with toxic
          substances we have created and exploited. Thus, in 2002 the architectural firm R&Sie designed
          Dusty Relief, an electrostatic building in Bangkok that would collect the dirt around it, rather than try
          to shuffle it somewhere else (Figures 11 and 12).14 Eventually the building would be coated with a
          gigantic fur coat of dirt.15

          Such new ideas are counterintuitive from the standpoint of regular post-1970s environmentalism.
          Process relationism has been the presiding deity of this thinking, insofar as it thinks flows are better
          than solids. But thinking this way on a planetary scale becomes absurd. Why is it better to stir the shit
          around inside the toilet bowl faster and faster rather than just leaving it there? Monitoring, regulating,
          and controlling flows: Is ecological ethics and politics just this? Regulating flows and sending them
          where you think they need to go is not relating to nonhumans. Regulation of flows is just a
          contemporary mode of window dressing of the substances of ontotheological nihilism, the becomings
          and processes with which Nietzsche wanted to undermine philosophy.

          itself. This strange paradox is fundamentally, structurally imbalanced. Consider the most basic
          process of capitalism: the turning of raw materials into products. Now for a capitalist, the raw
          materials are not strictly natural. They simply exist prior to whatever labor process the capitalist is
          going to exert on them. Surely here we see the problem. Whatever exists prior to the specific labor
          process is a lump that only achieves definition as valuable product once the labor has been exerted on
          it.

          What capitalism makes is some kind of stuff called capital. The very definition of “raw materials”
          in economic theory is simply “the stuff that comes in through the factory door.” Again, it doesn’t
          matter what it is. It could be sharks or steel bolts. At either end of the process we have featureless
          chunks of stuff—one of those featureless chunks being human labor. The point is to convert the stuff
          that comes in to money. Industrial capitalism is philosophy incarnate in stocks, girders, and human
          sweat. What philosophy? If you want a “realism of the remainder,” just look around you. “Realism of
          the remainder” means that yes, for sure, there is something real outside of our access to it—but we
          can only classify it as an inert resistance to our probing, a grey goo, to adapt a term suggested by
          thinking about nanotechnology—tiny machines eating everything until reality becomes said goo.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          It’s no wonder that industrial capitalism has turned the Earth into a dangerous desert. It doesn’t
          really care what comes through the factory door, just as long as it generates more capital. Do we want
          to sustain a world based on a philosophy of grey goo? (Again, the term that some futurologists use to
          describe the nightmare of nanoscale robots mashing everything up into a colorless morass.) Nature is
          the featureless remainder at either end of the process of production. Either it’s exploitable stuff, or
          value-added stuff. Whatever it is, it’s basically featureless, abstract, grey. It has nothing to do with
          nematode worms and orangutans, organic chemicals in comets and rock strata. You can scour the
          earth, from a mountaintop to the Marianas Trench. You will never find Nature. It’s an empty category
          looking for something to fill it.

        <p id="p1">
          Rather than only evaporating everything into a sublime ether (Marx via Macbeth: “All that is solid
          melts into air”), capitalism also requires and keeps firm long-term inertial structures such as families,
          as Fernand Braudel explored.17 The Koch brothers and GE are two contemporary examples. One part
          of capital, itself a hyperobject, is its relentless revolutionizing of its mode of production. But the
          other part is tremendous inertia. And the tremendous inertia happens to be on the side of the modern.
          That is, the political ontology in which there is an “away.” But there is no “away” in the time of
          hyperobjects.

        <p id="p1">
          Capitalism did away with feudal and prefeudal myths such as the divine hierarchy of classes of
          people. In so doing, however, it substituted a giant <a href="#">myth<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover9.png" /></a> of its own: Nature. Nature is precisely the
          lump that exists prior to the capitalist labor process. Heidegger has the best term for it: Bestand
          (standing reserve). Bestand means “stuff,” as in the ad from the 1990s, “Drink Pepsi: Get Stuff.”
          There is an ontology implicit in capitalist production: materialism as defined by Aristotle. This
          specific form of materialism is not fascinated with material objects in all their manifold specificity.
          It’s just stuff. This viewpoint is the basis of Aristotle’s problem with materialism. Have you ever
          seen or handled matter? Have you ever held a piece of “stuff”? To be sure one has seen plenty of
          objects: Santa Claus in a department store, snowflakes, photographs of atoms. But have I ever seen
          matter or stuff as such? Aristotle says it’s a bit like searching through a zoo to find the “animal” rather
          than the various species such as monkeys and mynah birds.18 Marx says exactly the same thing
          regarding capital.19 As Nature goes, so goes matter. The two most progressive physical theories of
          our age, ecology and quantum theory, need have nothing to do with it.
          <p />
          <p id="p1">
            What is Bestand? Bestand is stockpiling. Row upon row of big box houses waiting to be
            inhabited. Terabyte after terabyte of memory waiting to be filled. Stockpiling is the art of the zeugma
            —the yoking of things you hear in phrases such as “wave upon wave” or “bumper to bumper.”
            Stockpiling is the dominant mode of social existence. Giant parking lots empty of cars, huge tables in
            restaurants across which you can’t hold hands, vast empty lawns. Nature is stockpiling. Range upon
            range of mountains, receding into the distance. Rocky Flats nuclear bomb trigger factory was sited
            precisely to evoke this mountainous stockpile. The eerie strangeness of this fact confronts us with the
            ways in which we still believe that Nature is “over there”—that it exists apart from technology, apart
            from history. Far from it. Nature is the stockpile of stockpiles.

            What exactly are we sustaining when we talk about sustainability? An intrinsically out-of-control

            Natural value. Result? Mountain ranges of inertia, piling higher every year, while humans boil away
            in the agony of uncertainty. Look at Manufactured Landscapes, the ocean of telephone dials, dials as

            cups created by Tara Donovan in Untitled (Plastic Cups) (2006; Figure 13). In massive piles, the
            cups reveal properties hidden from the view of a person who uses a single cup at a time, a viscous (in
            my terms) malleability. In Donovan’s title, “cups” are in parentheses, the “untitled” outside
            parenthesis, as if to highlight the way the cups are “saying” something beyond their human use:
            something unspeakable for a human. The title of no-title places the work both inside and outside
            human social and philosophical space, like a garbage dump, an idea the gigantic pile surely evokes.

            Societies embody philosophies. What we have in modernity is considerably worse than just
            instrumentality. Here we must depart from Heidegger. What’s worse is the location of essence in
            some beyond, away from any specific existence. To this extent, capitalism is itself Heideggerian!
            Whether we call it scientism, deconstruction, relationism, or good-old-fashioned Platonic forms,
            there is no essence in what exists. Either the beyond is itself nonexistent (as in deconstruction or
            nihilism), or it’s some kind of real away from “here.” The problem, then, is not essentialism but this
            very notion of a beyond. This beyond is what Tara Donovan’s work destroys.

            Tony Hayward was the CEO of BP at the time of the Deepwater Horizon oil pipe explosion, and
            his callousness made international headlines. Hayward said that the Gulf of Mexico was a huge body
            of water, and that the spill was tiny by comparison. Nature would absorb the industrial accident. I
            don’t want to quibble about the difference in size between the Gulf and the spill, as if an even larger
            spill would somehow have gotten it into Hayward’s thick head that it was bad news. I simply want to
            point out the metaphysics involved in Hayward’s assertion, which we could call capitalist
            essentialism. The essence of reality is capital and Nature. Both exist in an ethereal beyond. Over
            here, where we live, is an oil spill. But don’t worry. The beyond will take care of it.
          </p>
          <p id="p1">
            Meanwhile, despite Nature, despite grey goo, real things writhe and smack into one another. Some
            leap out because industry malfunctions, or functions only too well. Oil bursts out of its ancient
            sinkhole and floods the Gulf of Mexico. Gamma rays shoot out of plutonium for twenty-four thousand
            years. Hurricanes congeal out of massive storm systems, fed by the heat from the burning of  <a href="#">fossil fuels<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover12.png" /></a> .
            The ocean of telephone dials mounts ever higher. Paradoxically, capitalism has unleashed
            myriad objects upon us, in their manifold horror and sparkling splendor. Two hundred years of
            idealism, two hundred years of seeing humans at the center of existence, and now the objects take
            revenge, terrifyingly huge, ancient, long-lived, threateningly minute, invading every cell in our body.
            When we flush the toilet, we imagine that the U-bend takes the waste away into some ontologically
            alien realm.21 Ecology is now beginning to tell us about something very different: a flattened world
            without ontological U-bends. A world in which there is no “away.” Marx was partly wrong, then,
            when in The Communist Manifesto he claimed that in capitalism all that is solid melts into air. He
            didn’t see how a hypersolidity oozes back into the emptied-out space of capitalism. This oozing real
            can no longer be ignored, so that even when the spill is supposedly “gone and forgotten,” there it is,
            mile upon mile of strands of oil just below the surface, square mile upon square mile of ooze floating
            at the bottom of the ocean.22 It can’t be gone and forgotten—even ABC News knows that now.
            When I hear the word “sustainability” I reach for my sunscreen.
          </p>

          <p id="p1">
            The deep reason for why sustainability fails as a concept has to do with how we are not living in a
            world. It is thus time to question the very term ecology, since ecology is the thinking of home, and
            hence world (oikos plus logos). In a reality without a home, without world, what this study calls
            objects are what constitute reality. Objects are unique. Objects can’t be reduced to smaller objects or
            dissolved upward into larger ones. Objects are withdrawn from one another and from themselves.
            Objects are Tardis-like, larger on the inside than they are on the outside. Objects are uncanny.
            Objects compose an untotalizable nonwhole set that defies holism and reductionism. There is thus no
            top object that gives all objects value and meaning, and no bottom object to which they can be
            reduced. If there is no top object and no bottom object, it means that we have a very strange situation
            in which there are more parts than there are wholes.23 This makes holism of any kind totally
            impossible.
          </p>
          <p id="p1">
            Even if you bracket off a vast amount of reality, you will find that there is no top and bottom
            object in the small section you’ve demarcated. Even if you select only a sector of reality to study
            somewhere in the middle, like they do in ecological science (the mesocosm), you will also find no
            top or bottom object, even as it pertains to that sector alone. It’s like a magnet. If you cut it, the two
            halves still have a north and a south pole. There is no such thing as “half” a magnet versus a “whole”
            one. Why is holism such a bad idea? Surely there could be other possible holisms that adopt some
            version of both–and thinking so that neither the parts nor the whole—whatever the whole might be—
            are greater. Perhaps the parts are not necessarily lesser than the whole but exist in some both–and
            synergistic fashion; you could have—simultaneously—“withdrawn” objects and something else (just
            to satisfy our modern need for things that aren’t static, let’s say an open-ended, possibly alwaysexpanding,
            something else).
          </p>
          <p id="p1">
            First, we must walk through some semirelated points about this line of questioning. It sounds like
            good value to have “both–and” rather than “either–or,” to our somewhat consumerist minds (“buy one
            get one free”). But I’m afraid this is a case of either–or: holism or not. The parts are not replaceable
            components of the whole. The more we open up the Russian doll of an object, the more objects we
            find inside. Far more than the first object in the series, because all the relations between the objects
            and within them also count as objects. It’s what Lacanians call a not-all set. Objects in this sense are
            fundamentally not subject to phallogocentric rule. (Commercial break: If you’re having trouble with
            “object” at this point, why not try another term, such as “entity”?) What we encounter in OOO, which
            I have been expounding in these last couple of pages, is a Badiou-like set theory in which any number
            of affiliations between objects can be drawn. The contents of these sorts of sets are bigger than the
            container.

            Sometimes children’s books explore deep ontological issues. The title of A House Is a House for
            Me couldn’t be better for a book about ecology (see my observation above about oikos and logos).
            The text is a wonderfully jumbly plethora of objects:
          </p>
          <p id=p2 >
            Cartons are houses for crackers,
            </p>
              <p id=p2>
            Castles are houses for kings.
              </p>
                <p id=p2>
            The more that I think about houses,
            </p>
              <p id=p2>
            The more things are houses for things.
            </p>
<p id="p1">


            Home, oikos, is unstable. Who knows where it stops and starts? The poem presents us with an
increasingly dizzying array of objects. They can act as homes for other objects. And of course, in turn,
these homes can find themselves on the inside of other “homes.”
“Home” is purely “sensual”: it has to do with how an object finds itself inevitably on the inside of
some other object. The instability of oikos, and thus of ecology itself, has to do with this feature of
objects. A “house” is the way an object experiences the entity in whose interior it finds itself. So then
these sorts of things are also houses:
  </p>
<p id="p2">
A mirror’s a house for reflections…

  <p id="p2">

</p>
<p id="p2">

<p id="p1">
  The time of hyperobjects is the time during which we discover ourselves on the inside of some big
objects (bigger than us, that is): Earth, global warming, evolution. Again, that’s what the eco in
ecology originally means: oikos, home. The last two lines of A House Is a House for Me make this
very clear.
To display the poem’s effortless brio, a lot of silly, fun “houses” are presented in the penultimate
section as we hurry toward the conclusion, which then sets the record straight by talking about a
“real” house, the Earth. But this is not the case. OOO doesn’t claim that any object is “more real” than
any other. But it does discount some objects, which it calls sensual objects. What is a sensual object?
A sensual object is an appearance-for another object. The table-for my pencil is a sensual object.
The table-for my eyes is a sensual object. The table-for my dinner is a sensual object. Sensual objects
are wonderfully, disturbingly entangled in one another. This is where causality happens, not in some
mechanical basement. This is where the magical illusion of appearance happens. A mirror’s a house
for reflections. Yes, the mesh (the interrelatedness of everything) is a sensual object! Strange
strangers are the real objects! Some very important entities that environmentalism thinks of as real,
such as Nature, are also sensual objects. They appear “as” what they are for an experiencer or user
or apprehender. They are manifestations of what Harman calls the as-structure.26 They are asstructured
even though they appear to be some deep background to (human) events.

    This confusion of sensual and real, in the terms of A House Is House for Me, is like thinking that
bread really is a house for jam, and jam alone. Rather than simply an idea that occurs to me, and
perhaps to the jam, when it finds itself slathered in there. Marmalade wants in on the bread? Too bad,
marmalade is an artificial, unnatural parasite! Peanut butter? Illegal alien! Only jam is “natural,” such
that bread is only made-for-jam. See the problem with Nature? In OOO-ese, reification is precisely
the reduction of a real object to its sensual appearance-for another object. Reification is the
reduction of one entity to another’s fantasy about it.
    </p>
    <p id="p1">
      Nature is a reification in this sense. That’s why we need ecology without Nature. Maybe if we
turn Nature into something more fluid, it would work. Emergence is also a sensual object. And thus
it’s in danger of doing the work of reifying—strangely enough, given its reputation as an unreified,
flowy thing, despite its popularity as a replacement for terms such as nature. Emergence is always
emergence-for. Yet there is a deeper way to think emergence. Physis, emergence, sway, the way a
flower unfurls, seeming, upsurge of Being, are some of the terms Heidegger uses to characterize
what he considers to be the primary notion of the ancient Greek philosophers. There is an appearingto,
an emerging-for, going on. Being is not separated from seeming, at the most fundamental stage of
Heidegger’s account. And so there is no reason why a poem can’t be construed as a physical object in
as rich a sense as you like. It’s only counterintuitive if you think that entities come with two floors:
basement mechanics and a pretty living room on top. But for OOO, Heidegger’s terms for being are
simply elaborations on the as-structure. Whether you call it emergence or appearance, what we are
talking about is a sensual object.

        Thinking on a planetary scale means waking up inside an object, or rather a series of “objects
wrapped in objects”: Earth, the biosphere, climate, global warming.27 Ecological being-with does not
mean dusting some corner of an object so one doesn’t feel too dirty. Ecological being-with has to do
with acknowledging a radical uniqueness and withdrawal of things, not some vague sludge of apeiron
(using Anaximander’s term for “the limitless”). A circle, not an endless line, is a better emblem for
the constraint, yet openness, of things.28 Indeed, the vague sludge is precisely the problem of
pollution. Process relationism is simply the last philosophical reflex of the modernity that creates the
sludge. We need a philosophy of sparkling unicities; quantized units that are irreducible to their parts
or to some larger whole; sharp, specific units that are not dependent on an observer to make them
real.
These are considerations concerning the normative value of different ontologies. But there is a
deeper reason why hyperobjects are best seen not as processes, but as real entities in their own right.
Seen from a suitably high dimension, a process just is a static object. I would appear like a strange
worm with a cradle at one end and a grave at the other, in the eyes of a four-dimensional being. This
is not to see things sub specie aeternitatis, but as I argued previously, sub specie majoris: from a
slightly higher-dimensional perspective. Processes are sophisticated from a lower-dimensional
viewpoint. If we truly want to transcend anthropocentrism, this might not be the way to go. To think
some things as processes is ironically to reify them as much as the enemy of the process philosopher
supposedly sees things as static lumps. As static lumps go, Lorenz Attractors are pretty cool.
Processes are equally reifications of real entities. A process is a sensual translation, a parody of a
higher-dimensional object by a lower-dimensional being. A hyperobject is like a city—indeed a city
such as London could provide a good example of a hyperobject. Cities and hyperobjects are full of
strange streets, abandoned entrances, cul-de-sacs, and hidden interstitial regions.

          The Nuclear Guardianship movement advocates an approach to nuclear materials that is strikingly
similar to the way in which the electrostatic building simply accumulates dirt without shunting it
under the rug.29 There is no away to which we can meaningfully sweep the radioactive dust. Nowhere
is far enough or long-lasting enough. What must happen instead is that we must care consciously for
nuclear materials, which means keeping them above ground in monitored retrievable storage until
they are no longer radioactive. Remember that the half-life of plutonium-239 is 24,100 years. That’s
almost as long into the future as the Chauvet Cave paintings are in our past. The future of plutonium
exerts a causal influence on the present, casting its shadow backward through time. All kinds of
options are no longer thinkable without a deliberate concealment of the reality of radioactive objects.
Far, far more effort must be put into monitored retrievable storage than Thomas Sebeok’s disturbing
idea of an “atomic priesthood” that enforces ignorance about the hyperobject in question.30 The
documentary Into Eternity explores the immense challenge that the now immense heap of nuclear
materials on Earth pose to thinking and to democracy.31 The film is narrated for a far future
addressee, displacing the spurious now, which we habitually think as a point or a small, rigid bubble.

            Guardianship, care—to curate is to care for. We are the curators of a gigantic museum of non-art
in which we have found ourselves, a spontaneous museum of hyperobjects. The very nature of
democracy and society—Whom does it contain? Only humans? Whom, if any, can it exclude?—is
thrown into question. The atomic priesthood would prevent others from knowing the truth.32 The
attempt to care for hyperobjects and for their distant future guardians will strikingly change how
humans think about themselves and their relationships with nonhumans. This change will be a
symptom of a gradually emerging ecological theory and practice that includes social policy, ethics,
spirituality, and art, as well as science. Humans become, in Heidegger’s words, the guardians of
futurality, “the stillness of the passing of the last god.”33 Nuclear Guardianship has suggested
encasing plutonium in gold, that precious object of global reverence and lust, rather than sweeping it
away out of view. Encased in gold, which has the advantage of absorbing gamma rays, plutonium
could become an object of contemplation. Set free from use, plutonium becomes a member of a
democracy expanded beyond the human. Nature as such is a byproduct of automation. By embracing
the hyperobjects that loom into our social space, and dropping Nature, world, and so on, we have a
chance to create more democratic modes of coexistence between humans and with nonhumans. But
these modes are not discernible within traditional Western parameters, since future generations—and
further futures than that, are now included on “this” side of any ethical or political decision.34
            </p>
            <p id="p1">
              Nuclear Guardianship sees nuclear materials as a unit: a hyperobject. This vision summons into
human fields of thinking and action something that is already there. The summoning is to nuclear
materials to join humans in social space, rather than remain on the outside. Or better, it’s an
acknowledgment by humans that nuclear materials are already occupying social space. It’s an
intrinsically scary thought. But wishing not to think it is just postponing the inevitable. To wish this
thought away is tantamount to the cleanup operations that simply sweep the contaminated dust,
garbage, and equipment away to some less politically powerful constituency. As a member of society,
nuclear materials are a unit, a quantum that is not reducible to its parts or reducible upward into some
greater whole. Nuclear materials constitute a unicity: finitude means just this. Nuclear materials may
present us with a very large finitude, but not an infinitude. They simply explode what we mean by
finitude. They are not objective lumps limited in time and space, but unique beings.35 They have
everything that Heidegger argues is unique to Dasein.
Hyperobjects are futural, as the section “Interobjectivity” demonstrated. They scoop out the
objectified now of the present moment into a shifting uncertainty. Hyperobjects loom into human time
like the lengthening shadow of a tree across the garden lawn in the bright sunshine of an ending
afternoon. The end of the world is not a sudden punctuation point, but rather it is a matter of deep
time. Twenty-four thousand years into the future, no one will be meaningfully related to me. Yet
everything will be influenced by the tiniest decisions I make right now.36 Inside the hyperobject
nuclear radiation, I am like a prisoner, and a future person is like another prisoner. We are kept
strictly apart, yet I guess his existence. There is a rumor going around the prison. If I make a deal with
the police and pin the blame for my crime on the other prisoner, and he says nothing, I can go free and
he receives a longer sentence. However, if I say nothing and he says nothing together, we both get a
minor sentence. Yet if we both betray the other, we receive an even longer sentence. I can never be
sure what the other will do. It would be optimal if I emphasize my self-interest above all other
considerations. Yet it would be best if I act with a regard to the well-being of the other prisoner.

                    Parfit subjects an astonishing array of self-interest theories (variously modified to include
relatives, friends, neighbors, descendants, and so on) to numerous tests based on the Prisoner’s
Dilemma. The Prisoner’s Dilemma encourages one to think about how change begins: one thinks of
the other, one brings the other into decisions that are supposedly about one’s self-interest. To this
extent the Prisoner’s Dilemma is formally collectivist even though it lacks a positive collectivist or
socialist content. The kinds of compromise necessitated by the Prisoner’s Dilemma may strike
ideological purists as weak. It is precisely this weakness that makes the so-called compromises
workable and just. Imagine a future self with interests so different from one’s own that to some extent
she or he constitutes a different self: not your reincarnation or someone else—you yourself. This
person in the future is like the prisoner being interrogated in the other room. The future self is thus
unimaginably distant in one sense, and yet hyperobjects have brought her into the adjoining prison
cell. She is strange yet intimate. The best course of action is to act with regard to her. This radical
letting go of what constitutes a self has become necessary because of hyperobjects. The weakness of
this ethical position is determined by the radical withdrawal of the future being: I can never fully
experience, explain, or otherwise account for her, him, or it. The end of the world is a time of
weakness.

                      The ethics that can handle hyperobjects is directed toward the unknown and unknowable future, the
future that Jacques Derrida calls l’avenir.38 Not the future we can predict and manage, but an
unknowable future, a genuinely future future. In the present moment, we must develop an ethics that
addresses what Derrida calls l’arrivant, the absolutely unexpected and unexpectable arrival, or what
I call the strange stranger, the stranger whose strangeness is forever strange—it cannot be tamed or
rationalized away. This stranger is not so unfamiliar: uncanny familiarity is one of the strange
stranger’s traits. Only consider anyone who has a long-term partner: the person they wake up with
every day is the strangest person they know. The future future and the strange stranger are the weird
and unpredictable entities that honest ecological thinking compels us to think about. When we can see
that far into the future and that far around Earth, a curious blindness afflicts us, a blindness far more
mysterious than simple lack of sight, since we can precisely see so much more than ever. This
blindness is a symptom of an already-existing intimacy with all lifeforms, knowledge of which is now
thrust on us whether we like it or not.

                        Parfit’s assault on utilitarian self-interest takes us to the point at which we realize that we are not
separate from our world. Humans must learn to care for fatal substances that will outlast them and
their descendants beyond any meaningful limit of self-interest. What we need is an ethics of the other,
an ethics based on the proximity of the stranger. The decision in the 1990s, rapidly overturned, to
squirrel plutonium away into knives and forks and other domestic objects appears monstrous, and so
would any attempt to “work” it into something convenient. Hyperobjects insist that we care for them
in the open. “Out of sight, out of mind” is strictly untenable. There is no “away” to throw plutonium
in. We are stuck with it, in the same way as we are stuck with our biological bodies. Plutonium finds
itself in the position of the “neighbor” in Abrahamic religions—that awkward condition of being
alien and intimate at the very same time.

                          The enormity of very large finitude hollows out my decisions from the inside. Now every time I so
much as change a confounded light bulb, I have to think about global warming. It is the end of the
world, because I can see past the lip of the horizon of human worlding. Global warming reaches into
“my world” and forces me to use LEDs instead of bulbs with filaments. This aspect of the
Heideggerian legacy begins to teeter under the weight of the hyperobject. The normative defense of
worlds looks wrongheaded.39 The ethical and political choices become much clearer and less
divisive if we begin to think of pollution and global warming and radiation as effects of hyperobjects
rather than as flows or processes that can be managed. These flows are often eventually shunted into
some less powerful group’s backyard. The Native American tribe must deal with the radioactive
waste. The African American family must deal with the toxic chemical runoff. The Nigerian village
must deal with the oil slick. Rob Nixon calls this the slow violence of ecological oppression.40 It is
helpful to think of global warming as something like an ultra slow motion nuclear bomb. The
incremental effects are almost invisible, until an island disappears underwater. Poor people—who
include most of us on Earth at this point—perceive the ecological emergency not as degrading an
aesthetic picture such as world but as an accumulation of violence that nibbles at them directly.

                            Without a world, there are simply a number of unique beings (farmers, dogs, irises, pencils, LEDs,
and so on) to whom I owe an obligation through the simple fact that existence is coexistence. I don’t
have to run through my worlding checklist to ensure that the nonhuman in question counts as something
I could care for. “If you answered mostly (A), then you have a world. If you answered mostly (B),
then you are poor in world (German, weltarm). If you answered mostly (C), then you have no world
whatsoever.” What remains without a world is intimacy. Levinas touches on it in his ethics of alterity,
although he is incorrect to make this otherness as vague as the “rustling” of blank existence, the “there
is” (il y a).41 The other is fully here, before I am, as Levinas argues. But the other has paws and sharp
surfaces, the other is decorated with leaves, the other shines with starlight. Kafka writes:

                              At first glance it looks like a flat star-shaped spool for thread, and indeed it does seem to
have thread wound upon it; to be sure, they are only old, broken-off bits of thread, knotted
and tangled together, of the most varied sorts and colors. But it is not only a spool, for a
small wooden crossbar sticks out of the middle of the star, and another small rod is
joined to that at a right angle. By means of this latter rod on one side and one of the points
of the star on the other, the whole thing can stand upright as if on two legs.42

                                “The idea that he is likely to survive me I find almost painful.”43 Kafka’s Odradek resembles the
hyperobject in this respect. Indeed we have let him into our home somehow, like mercury and
microwaves, like the ultraviolet rays of the sun. Odradek is what confronts us at the end of the world,
not with a shout but with a breathless voice “like the rustling of fallen leaves.”44 Things appear in
their disturbing weakness and lameness, technical terms describing the human attunement to
hyperobjects that I have begun to elucidate.
Without a world, there is no Nature. Without a world, there is no life. What exists outside the
charmed circles of Nature and life is a charnel <a href="#">ground<img src="images/tweetscrape/hover8.png" /></a> , a place of life and death, of death-in-life and
life-in-death, an undead place of zombies, viroids, junk DNA, ghosts, silicates, cyanide, radiation,
demonic forces, and pollution. My resistance to ecological awareness is a resistance to the charnel
ground. It is the calling of the shaman to enter the charnel ground and to try to stay there, to pitch a tent
there and live there, for as long as possible. Since there are no charnel grounds to speak of in the
West, the best analogy, used by some Tibetan Buddhists (from whom the image derives), is the
emergency room of a busy hospital. People are dying everywhere. There is blood and noise,
equipment rushing around, screams. When the charm of world is dispelled, we find ourselves in the
emergency room of ecological coexistence.
                                </p>
<p id="p1">
  In the charnel ground, worlds can never take root. Charnel grounds are too vivid for that. Any soft
focusing begins to look like violence. Haunting a charnel ground is a much better analogy for
ecological coexistence than inhabiting a world. There is something immensely soothing about charnel
grounds. It is what is soothing about Buddhism’s First Noble Truth, the truth of suffering.
Traditionally, Buddhism recognizes three types of suffering. There is the pain of pain, as when you hit
your thumb with a hammer, and then you close your whole hand in the door as you rush into the car to
get to the doctor’s because of your thumb. Then there is the pain of alteration, in which you
experience first plea-sure, then pain when pleasure evaporates. Then there is “all-pervasive pain,”
which Chögyam Trungpa beautifully describes as a “fundamental creepy quality” akin to Heidegger’s
description of Angst.45 It is this quality that comes close to the notion of world. All-pervasive pain
has to do with the fixation and confusion that constitute the Six Realms of Existence (traditionally,
animals, humans, gods, jealous gods, hungry ghosts, and hell). In paintings of the Wheel of Life, the
Six Realms are held in the jaws of Yama, the Lord of Death.
  </p>
  <p id="p1">
    It is this outermost perspective of the jaws of death that provides an entry point into the charnel
ground. To a Buddhist, ecophenomenological arguments that base ethics on our embeddedness in a
lifeworld begin to look like a perverse aestheticization, celebrations of confusion and suffering for
confusion’s and suffering’s sake. It doesn’t really matter what is on the TV (murder, addiction, fear,
lust). Each realm of existence is just a TV show taking up “space” in the wider space of the charnel
ground of reality, “the desert of the real.”46 Trebbe Johnson and others have established the practice
of Global Earth Exchanges, actions of finding, then giving something beautiful in a “wounded place,”
such as a toxic dump or a nuclear power facility.47 Or consider Buddhist practitioners of tonglen:
“sending and taking,” a meditation practice in which one breathes out compassion for the other, while
breathing in her or his suffering. Tonglen is now used in the context of polluted places. Consider
Chöd, the esoteric ritual of visualizing cutting oneself up as a feast for the demons, another practice
that has been taken on with reference to ecological catastrophes. Or consider the priests at the Rocky Flats nuclear bomb trigger factory, such as walking meditation.

    Our actions build up a karmic pattern that looks from a reified distance like a realm such as hell orheaven. But beyond the violence that we do, it’s the distance that reifies the pattern into a worldpicture that needs to be shattered. Whether it’s Hobbiton, or the jungles of Avatar, or the NationalParks and conservation areas over yonder on the hither side of the screen (though possibly behind thewindshield of an SUV), or the fields and irrigation channels on the hither side of the wilderness—it’sall a world picture. I’m not saying we need to uproot the trees—I’m saying that we need to smash theaestheticization: in case of ecological emergency, break glass.

      Our increasing knowledge of global warming ends all kinds of ideas, but it creates other ones. The
essence of these new ideas is the notion of coexistence—that is after all what ecology profoundly
means. We coexist with human lifeforms, nonhuman lifeforms, and non-lifeforms, on the insides of a
series of gigantic entities with whom we also coexist: the ecosystem, biosphere, climate, planet,
Solar System. A multiple series of nested Russian dolls. Whales within whales within whales.
Consider the hypothetical planet Tyche, far out in the Oort Cloud beyond Pluto. We can’t see it
directly but we can detect evidence of its possible existence. Planets are hyperobjects in most senses.
They have Gaussian geometry and measurable spacetime distortion because they are so massive.
They affect everything that exists on and in them. They’re “everywhere and nowhere” up close
(viscosity). (Point to Earth right now—you have a number of options of where to point.) They are
really old and really huge compared with humans. And there’s something disturbing about the
existence of a planet that far away, perhaps not even of “our” solar system originally, yet close
enough to be uncanny (a very large finitude). And it’s unseen except for its hypothetical influence on
objects such as comets: “The awful shadow of some unseen power,” in Shelley’s words. Tyche is a
good name. It means contingency in Greek, so it’s the speculative realism planet par excellence.
(“Luck” and “chance” are rather tame alternative translations. Tyche is what happens to you in a
tragedy if your name is Oedipus.) And for now, what could be more obviously withdrawn?
The historic moment at which hyperobjects become visible by humans has arrived. This visibility
changes everything. Humans enter a new age of sincerity, which contains an intrinsic irony that is
beyond the aestheticized, slightly plastic irony of the postmodern age. What do I mean?

        This is a momentous era, at which we achieve what has sometimes been called ecological
awareness. Ecological awareness is a detailed and increasing sense, in science and outside of it, of
the innumerable interrelationships among lifeforms and between life and non-life. Now this
awareness has some very strange properties. First of all, the awareness ends the idea that we are
living in an environment! This is so bizarre that we should dwell on it a little. What it means is that
the more we know about the interconnection, the more it becomes impossible to posit some entity
existing beyond or behind the interrelated beings. When we look for the environment, what we find
are discrete lifeforms, non-life, and their relationships. But no matter how hard we look, we won’t
find a container in which they all fit; in particular we won’t find an umbrella that unifies them, such as
world, environment, ecosystem, or even, astonishingly, Earth.

times higher than normal because of the Sendai reactor meltdowns. We know this. We know we are

which drinks rainwater? The more we know, the harder it is to make a one-sided decision about
anything. As we enter the time of hyperobjects, Nature disappears and all the modern certainties that
seemed to accompany it. What remains is a vastly more complex situation that is uncanny and intimate
at the same time.

                  There is no exit from this situation. Thus the time of hyperobjects is a time of sincerity: a time in
which it is impossible to achieve a final distance toward the world. But for this very reason, it is also
a time of irony. We realize that nonhuman entities exist that are incomparably more vast and powerful
than we are, and that our reality is caught in them. What things are and how they seem, and how we
know them, is full of gaps, yet vividly real. Real entities contain time and space, exhibiting nonlocal
effects and other interobjective phenomena, writing us into their histories. Astonishingly, then, the
mesh of interconnection is secondary to the strange stranger. The mesh is an emergent property of the
things that coexist, and not the other way around. For the modernist mind, accustomed to systems and
structures, this is an astounding, shocking discovery. The more maps we make, the more real things
tear through them. Nonhuman entities emerge through our mapping, then they destroy them.

                  Coexistence is in our face: it is our face. We are made of nonhuman and nonsentient and nonliving
entities. It’s not a cozy situation: it’s a spooky, uncanny situation. We find ourselves in what robotics
and CGI designers call the uncanny valley (Figure 14). It’s a commonly known phenomenon in CGI
design that if you build figures that look too much like humans, you are at risk of crossing a threshold
and falling into the uncanny valley (Plate 2). In the uncanny valley, beings are strangely familiar and
familiarly strange. The valley seems to explain racism quite well, because the dehumanization
suffered by victims of racism makes them more uncanny to the racist than, say, a dog or a faceless
robot. Hitler was very fond of his dog Blondi and yet dehumanized Jews and others. That’s the
trouble with some kinds of environmentalist language: they skip blithely over the uncanny valley to
shake hands with beings on the other side. But, as I’m going to argue, there is only another side if you
are holding on to some fictional idea of humanness, an idea that ecological awareness actually
refutes. The uncanny valley, in other words, is only a valley if you already have some quite racist
assumptions about lifeforms.

                    With ecological awareness there is no “healthy person” on the other side of the valley. Everything
in your world starts to slip into the uncanny valley, whose sides are infinite and slick. It’s more like
an uncanny charnel ground, an ER full of living and dying and dead and newly born people, some of
whom are humans, some of whom aren’t, some of whom are living, some of whom aren’t. Everything
in your world starts to slip into this charnel ground situation, including your world.

                      FIGURE 14. Masahiro Mori’s diagram of the uncanny valley. Intimacy implies the grotesque. Since
ecological awareness consists in a greater intimacy with a greater number of beings than modernity is
capable of thinking, humans must pass through the uncanny valley as they begin to engage these beings. For reasons given in the book, this valley might be infinite in extent.

                        Isn’t it strange that we can admire comets, black holes, and suns—entities that would destroy us if
they came within a few miles of us—and we can’t get a handle on global warming? Isn’t global
climate now in the uncanny valley? Doesn’t this have something to do with art? Because when you
look at the stars and imagine life on other planets, you are looking through the spherical glass screen
of the atmosphere at objects that appear to be behind that glass screen—for all the developments
since Ptolemy, in other words, you still imagine that we exist on the inside of some pristine glass
sphere. The experience of cosmic wonder is an aesthetic experience, a three-dimensional surround
version of looking at a picturesque painting in an art gallery. So Jane Taylor’s Romantic-period poem
“The Star” is about seeing stars through the atmosphere, in which they seem to “Twinkle, twinkle.”
Two and a half thousand people showed up at the University of Arizona in Tucson for a series of
talks on cosmology.49 Evidently there is a thirst for thinking about the universe as a whole. Why is the
same fascination not there for global warming? It’s because of the oppressive claustrophobic horror
of actually being inside it. You can spectate “the universe” as an ersatz aesthetic object: you have the
distance provided by the biosphere itself, which acts as a spherical cinema screen. Habit tells us that
what’s displayed on that screen (like projections in a planetarium) is infinite, distant—the whole
Kantian sublime. But inside the belly of the whale that is global warming, it’s oppressive and hot and
there’s no “away” anymore. And it’s profoundly regressing: a toxic intrauterine experience, on top of
which we must assume responsibility for it. And what neonatal or prenatal infant should be
responsible for her mother’s existence? Global warming is in the uncanny valley, as far as
hyperobjects go. Maybe a black hole, despite its terrifying horror, is so far away and so wondrous
and so fatal (we would simply cease to exist anywhere near it) that we marvel at it, rather than try to
avoid thinking about it or feel grief about it. The much smaller, much more immediately dangerous
hole that we’re in (inside the hyperobject global warming) is profoundly disturbing, especially
because we created it.
